            <p>I love playing Magic the Gathering on my free time <em>(if the spinning card above this text didn't already spoil that already. ðŸ˜‰)</em></p>
            <p>Other than that I love cooking food, hanging out with friends and playing video games on my free time</p>
            <p>When I don't have free time <em>(work)</em> I like to work with frontend and backend, but recently this has been restricted to frontend, nothing wrong with that of course! ðŸ˜ƒ</p>
